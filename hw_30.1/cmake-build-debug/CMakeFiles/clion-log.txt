CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory C:/Users/iwaly/Documents/Skillbox-Homework/hw_30.1/cmake-build-debug/_deps/cpr-subbuild/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/iwaly/Skillbox-Homework/hw_30.1/cmake-build-debug/_deps/cpr-subbuild where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
